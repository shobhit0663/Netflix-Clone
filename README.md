# Netflix-Clone
 In this project, you'll create a Netflix clone focusing solely on HTML and CSS. The aim is to replicate the visual design and layout of Netflix's homepage. By structuring web pages and applying styles, you'll build a static frontend, practicing web design techniques without any backend or dynamic functionality. Perfect for honing layout skills!
